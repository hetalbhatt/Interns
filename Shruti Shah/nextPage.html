        <div class="text">It was said that coffee was discovered by a goat herder in Ethiopia in the 1500s.  He saw his goats eating coffee cherries. Afterwards, he observed a change in their behavior. They gained a high amount of energy and they didnâ€™t sleep at night.  The herder shared his findings with local monks and then after they made a drink with coffee beans, they realized they could stay up all night and pray. Then, they spread the word to other Ethiopian monks and it reached across the civilized world.</div>
